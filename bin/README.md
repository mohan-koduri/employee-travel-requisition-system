Chapter  1

INTRODUCTION
1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Employee Travel Management & Reimbursement System. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do and the constraints under which it must operate.
1.2. Scope of Project
The main objective of the project is to automate the existing travel system. It will help the employee to manage the travel plans. Our project aims at Business process automation, ie. We have tried to computerize various processes of travel.
1.3. Existing System
In the present system the employee has to go and tell the travel agent regarding the business trip. It is a tedious work for employee to take approval from the project manager and then taking the approved request to the travel agent to book the tickets. It may happen that the project manager is unavailable to give the approval for the trip which may have come spontaneously to the employee. The travel agent has to maintain the paperwork of the documents and also have to maintain the travel expenses. The travel agent has to get approval from the project manager regarding the trip in case the cost exceeds the permitted slab to the employee.

1.4. Proposed System
A Web based approach towards maintaining travel request from employee in a centralized manner and ultimately reducing the paperwork involved in each application and automating the entire process to make the application process faster and easier. The system will allow one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements from one single interface.
